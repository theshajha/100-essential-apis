# API Odyssey

API Odyssey is a collection of 100 essential APIs, each designed to offer unique and valuable functionalities. This project aims to provide a wide range of services, from data processing to utility functions, all accessible via a user-friendly API interface.

## APIs Live

Below is a list of currently live APIs. Click on each to access their specific `README.md` for detailed documentation:

- [Weather Forecast API](./apis/weather_forecast/README.md) - How to integrate Weather Forecast API.
- [IP Geocode API](./apis/ip_geocode/README.md) - How to integrate IP Geocoding API.
- [Email Verification API](./apis/email_verification/README.md) - How to integrate Email Verification API.

## Considerations

- **Scalability**: Designed to handle varying loads, ensuring high availability and performance.
- **Security**: Emphasis on secure data handling and API access.
- **Modularity**: Each API is developed as an independent module, facilitating easy updates and maintenance.
- **Technology Stack**: Utilizes Django framework and Docker for a robust and scalable architecture.

## What's Next and Roadmap

- **Short-Term Goals**:
  - Increase the number of APIs to 50 by Q2 2024.
  - Implement advanced authentication mechanisms.

- **Long-Term Vision**:
  - Reach 100 fully functional APIs covering a broad range of utilities.
  - Incorporate AI and ML-based APIs.

- **Roadmap**:
  - [ ] API 3 - Scheduled for release in Jan 2024.
  - [ ] Enhance API 2 with additional features by Mar 2024.
  - ... (additional roadmap items)
